# üõ°Ô∏è Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is an **end-to-end system** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. 
It integrates **data engineering, model training, and experiment tracking** into a production-ready architecture.

# üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository and move into the project root:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gagansingh894/Real-Time-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd Real-Time-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```
2. Start all services using Docker Compose (ensure you have docker compose installed)
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
3. Wait for all containers (Airflow, Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, MLflow, etc.) to start.
4. Trigger workflows from the Airflow UI or via the CLI.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Resource Usage**

Running this system locally with Docker Compose is memory intensive.  
At least **18 GB of RAM** is recommended to run all services smoothly.

## üìå Architecture
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="600"/>
</p>

1. **File System** ‚Üí Stores raw transaction data.  
2. **ETL Spark Job** ‚Üí Reads raw data, transforms it, and persists it into Cassandra.  
3. **Cassandra** ‚Üí Acts as the feature store for model training.  
4. **ML Training Spark Job** ‚Üí Reads training data from Cassandra and trains models.  
5. **MLflow Tracking Server** ‚Üí Logs trained models and experiment metadata.  
   - **MinIO** ‚Üí Stores ML models and artifacts.  
   - **Postgres** ‚Üí Stores MLflow experiment and run metadata.  
6. **Stream Processing Job** -> Consumes new transactions from kafka stream, transform, predict and persist 
7. **Kafka Producer** -> Generates transactions and publishes to topic
8. **Airflow** -> Orchestrates ETL, ML training, Spark Streaming and Kafka Producer
